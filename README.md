# Study on the impact of fuzzer-found compiler bugs

## Getting Started

### Download the virtual machine (~1 GB)

Download the VM from the [artifact page](https://srg.doc.ic.ac.uk/projects/compiler-bugs/artifact.html)

Go to the directory of the downloaded VM and use the md5 or md5sum command-line tool to generate the hash. It should be `edbd389e5607211cb5317dce87b885bf`.


Make sure you have at least 20 GB disk space to run the following example.

### Start the virtual machine 

For Windows, Linux, Macintosh and Solaris, download Oracle VirtualBox from www.virtualbox.org and import the VM.

For Ubuntu Linux terminal users, you can

1. Install the Oracle VirtualBox

```
sudo apt install virtualbox
```
2. Import our pre-build appliance
```
vboxmanage import compiler_bugs.ova
```
3. Start the VM and wait for it to boot up (about 30 seconds)
```
VBoxHeadless --startvm debian
```
4. Open another terminal and ssh to the VM (password: user42user42)
```
ssh -p 2222 user42@localhost
```
5. (Optional) Go to the working directory and update the git repo
```
cd /home/user42/compiler-bug-impact
git pull
```

### Generate the tables in Section 5

1. Go to the data directory
```
cd /home/user42/compiler-bug-impact/data
```
Here, all the logs of compiling the 309 Debian apps are in Build_Logs and all the data of the number of different assembly funtions are in Function_Logs.

2. Generate the tables in Section 5, e.g. to see Table 3, simply run 
```
./genTable3.sh
```
3. View the tables, e.g. to view Table 3 
```
./displayResults.sh results/table3.csv
```

### Small example to analyse the impact of EMI bug 26323 on two Debian apps

Network access in the VM is required to run the example.

1. Go to the example directory 
```
cd /home/user42/compiler-bug-impact/example
```
2. Run the example 
```
./run_example.sh
```

NOTE: You will have to enter the sudo password "user42user42" after several minutes of downloading and installing the compilers.

This script will 
- Download the compilers (fixed, buggy and warning-laden/cop) corresponding to EMI bug 26323 from Gitlab if not downloaded earlier
- Install this compiler in the chroot
- Run the steps-llvm script with compiler over two apps: afl and libraw
- Compute the number of different assembly functions for these two apps

The results are saved in `/home/user42/compiler-bug-impact/example/results/26323`

The build log resides in `~/compiler-bug-impact/example/results/26323/new-26323.txt`, you can compare it with the reference build log by:
```
grep -A4 "afl" ~/compiler-bug-impact/data/Build_Logs/EMI/new-26323.txt
grep -A4 "libraw" ~/compiler-bug-impact/data/Build_Logs/EMI/new-26323.txt
```
The function log resides in `~/compiler-bug-impact/example/26323/26323-func.txt`, you can compare it with the reference function analysis log by (note that no different assembly functions for afl):
```
grep -A2 "libraw" ~/compiler-bug-impact/data/Function_Logs/EMI/26323-func.txt
```
## Step-by-Step Instructions 
Refer to the part in the [pdf guide](artifact.pdf)

## Remove the VM to save space (for linux terminal users)
```
VBoxManage unregistervm --delete debian
```
